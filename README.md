# Ultri Open Platform

The Ultri Open Platform is a Docker based solution to easily spin up production ready environments locally or in the cloud.

It is composed of three main parts:

* Ultri Open Gateway
* Ultri Authentic8
* Ultri Fastify API

Each part has it's own repo and docker image. The recomended way to use them is through docker-compose as demonstrated in this repo.
